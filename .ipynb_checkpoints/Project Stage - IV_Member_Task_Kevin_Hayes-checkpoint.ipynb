    "\n",
    "- Member: (60 points)\n",
    "    - Utilize Linear and Non-Linear (polynomial with degree n) regression models to compare trends for a single state (each member should choose different state) and its counties (top 5 with highest number of cases). Start your data from 2020.06.01 (Monday) to 2021.01.03 (Sunday). \n",
    "        - X-Axis - number of days, Y-Axis number of new cases and deaths. Calcluate error using RMSE.(10 points)\n",
    "        - Identify which counties are most at risk. Model for top 5 counties with cases within a state and describe their trends. (10 points)\n",
    "        - Perform hypothesis tests on questions identified in Stage III. (30 points)\n",
    "            - e.x. *Does higher employment data (overall employment numbers) lead to higher covid case numbers or more rapid increase in covid cases.*. Here you would compare the covid cases to the state or county level enrichment data to prove or disprove your null hypothesis. In this case there will be a two tail - two sample t-test to see if there is a difference and then one-tail - two sample t-test to show higher or lower.\n",
    "            - you can also make 3 new hypotheses and do hypothesis tests on them.\n",
    "            - Depending on your type of data you can also perform Chi-square test for categorical hypothesis testing. \n",
    "    - For each of the aforemention analysis plot figures, the figures should include (10 points)\n",
    "        - trend line (based on the datasets from 2020.06.01 (Monday) to 2021.01.03 (Sunday)).\n",
    "        - prediction path (forecast 1 week).\n",
    "        - confidence intervals (error in prediction). (Further materials you may need to explore: https://lmc2179.github.io/posts/confidence_prediction.html; https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-plot-a-confidence-interval-in-python/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable**\n",
    "- Each member creates separate notebooks for member tasks.\n",
    "- Upload all notebooks and reports to Canvas. Attention: You need to submit both the team work and the member work. The team work will have a same grade within you teammates."
